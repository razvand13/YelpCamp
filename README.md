# Description
This is a Web Development project part of the online course [The Web Developer Bootcamp 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/).

The primary inspiration of this project is Yelp, but instead of adding and reviewing restaurants, YelpCamp does so with campgrounds. Anyone can register to become a user and upload or review campgrounds. Reviews and uploads can only be edited and deleted by their author.

Note that the database has been seeded, hence most of the campgrounds are very similar.

# How to run it

The application has been deployed on Render. See https://yelp-camp-razvand13.onrender.com for a showcase of the application.
